The goal is to determine the early readmission of the patient within 30 days of discharge. The problem is important for the following reasons. Despite high-quality evidence showing improved clinical outcomes for diabetic patients who receive various preventive and therapeutic interventions, many patients do not receive them. This can be partially attributed to arbitrary diabetes management in hospital environments, which fail to attend to glycemic control. Failure to provide proper diabetes care not only increases the managing costs for the hospitals (as the patients are readmitted) but also impacts the morbidity and mortality of the patients, who may face complications associated with diabetes.\n",

There are two major water systems to consider: one is centered on the city of Atlanta while the other is centered on the eastern coast of Georgia. This information indicates spatial dependency among different locations which are important to the forecast. For details of the data description, please refer to the file named README.docx.

Many different methods have been used in this regard; however, it has not yet been possible to achieve 100% success. Mine detection process consists of sensor design, data analysis and decision algorithm phases. The magnetic anomaly method works according to the principle of measuring the anomalies resulting from the object in the magnetic field that disturbs the structure of it, the magnetic field, and the data obtained at this point are used to determine the conditions such as motion and position. The determination of parameters such as position, depth or direction of motion using magnetic anomaly has been carried out since 1970.\n",
